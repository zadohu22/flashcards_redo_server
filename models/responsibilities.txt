Contains the model files that define the structure of the data and the operations that can be performed on that data. In the context of an MVC architecture, models represent the data and the rules to manipulate that data. They interact with the database using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Prisma, which simplifies database operations. Models define the schema of the data, handle data validation, and encapsulate the logic required to query and store data in the database. For example, a model might define a schema for a user, including fields like username, email, and password, and provide methods to create, read, update, and delete users in the database
